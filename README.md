# MachineLearningRealWorldProjects

Machine Learning is one of the hottest technology field in the world right now! This field is exploding with opportunities and career prospects. Machine Learning techniques are widely used in several sectors now a days such as banking, healthcare, finance, education transportation and technology.

I took this course to polish my machine learning skills and to complete some hands on Projects before starting my career as Machine learning Engineer.

Because in a practical life, machine learning seems to be complex and tough,thats why weâ€™ve designed a course to help break it down into real world use-cases that are easier to understand.

I have completed these Projects with the help of this course and It helped me a lot to explore and learn.
